# Hi, I am Marius 🙋‍♂️

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Programming newbie trying to learn web development topics in my free time. And I am going to build a portfolio of different projects the next months to grow as a web developer.

My first project was to setup a blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The main purpose of the blog is to track and share my learning progress. I personally find it difficult to keep track of the right topics and where to start, because they are like hundred different frameworks, tools, static site generators and other components out there related to web development. Beside basic stuff just like HTML, CSS, JavaScript or version control systems like Git.

So on the way from absolute beginner to a more skilled front-end developer, I want to use the blog to share my approach how I dealt with different issues to maybe help other people with similiar problems on their way.

Next to that I also like topics like digital minimalism, habit formation, learning techniques and increased productivity. And of course I love football ❤️⚽
