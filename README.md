## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm interested in web dev topics and trying to learn new web dev related stuff in my free time.

Currently I'm sharing mostly some solutions for frontend mentor challenges to get used to work with HTML and CSS concepts like grid and flexbox. For some projects I used sass or bootstrap. Apart from that I worked with JavaScript/TypeScript, node.js, express, ajax, phpMyAdmin and SQL for some university projects.

In future I want to share more projects using Angular and React (maybe Vue.js too) which I'm currently learning in university and by myself.
